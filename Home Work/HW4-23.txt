#Homework 5
##Problem 1
A Factorial Design of Experiments is performed with two factors $A$ and $B$ each run at two levels High and Low. The experiment is replicated three times $(n = 3)$. The data are entered below.
```{r}
resp<- c(27,31,18,30,29,33,22,32,26,34,19,29)
A <- as.factor(rep(c(0,1),6))
B <- as.factor(rep(c(0,0,1,1),3))
df1<- data.frame(A,B, resp)
df1
gmeans <- unlist(lapply(list(c(0,0),c(1,0),c(0,1),c(1,1)), function(x){
  sum(df1[which(df1[,1] == x[1] & df1[,2] == x[2]),3])
}))
names(gmeans) = c("(1)", "A", "B", "AB")
gmeans
```
Then,  

####i) Estimate the main effects of $A$ and $B$.
$\hat{A} = \frac{ab + a - b - (1)}{2n} = \frac{91 + 98 - 59 - 82}{6} = 8$

$\hat{B} = \frac{ab + b - a - (1)}{2n} = \frac{91 + 59 - 98 - 82}{6} = -5$

####ii) Estimate the interaction effect $AB$.
$\hat{AB} = \frac{ab - a - b + (1)}{2n} = \frac{91 - 98 - 59 + 82}{6} = 2.\bar{6}$

####iii) Conduct an appropriate ANOVA for the above data and test the significance of the main effects, and the interaction effects. Discuss the outcome in details. 
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(resp ~ A + B + A*B, data=df1)
anova(mod1)
```
The p values of the main effects are both well under a standard $\alpha$ of .05. This leads us to believe that they are significant. The interaction effect has a p value of `r anova(mod1)[3,5]` which is below .05, but not by much. Therefore we should be wary about accepting its significance. 

####iv) Prepare appropriate residual plots and comment of the model's adequacy.
