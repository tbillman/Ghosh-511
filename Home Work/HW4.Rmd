##Problem 4.22
We begin by constructing our dataset
```{r}
Prob422 = as.data.frame(matrix(rep(0,25*5), nrow = 25))
Prob422[,1] = 1:25
Prob422[,2] = c("A","B","D","C","E",
               "C","E","A","D","B",
               "B","A","C","E","D",
               "D","C","E","B","A",
               "E","D","B","A","C")
Prob422[,3] = gl(5,5)
Prob422[,4] = gl(5,1,25)
Prob422[,5] = c(8,7,1,7,3,
                11,2,7,3,8,
                4,9,10,1,5,
                6,8,6,6,10,
                4,2,3,8,8)
colnames(Prob422) = c("OBS","Ingredient", "Batch", "Day","Reaction.Time")
Prob422$Ingredient <- factor(Prob422$Ingredient)
Prob422$Batch <- factor(Prob422$Batch)
Prob422$Day <- factor(Prob422$Day)
Prob422
```

Looking at the analysis.
```{r}
prob422.lm <- lm(Reaction.Time ~ Ingredient + Batch + Day, data = Prob422)
anova(prob422.lm)
```
